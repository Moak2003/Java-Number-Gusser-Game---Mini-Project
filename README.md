# Java-Number-Gusser-Game---Mini-Project
This is a Java-based number guessing game where a guesser thinks of a number and players try to guess it. The umpire moderates the game, compares the guesses of the players, and announces the winner. It's a fun and interactive game that is made for purpose of mainly understanding the concept of classes in java.

This project is a simple number guessing game that allows the user to guess a number that is randomly generated by the guesser. The player needs to guess the number, and the umpire decides the winner based on who guesses the number correctly. The game involves one guesser and three players.

The game is implemented using Java and is executed in the command line. The program consists of three classes: Guesser, Player, and Umpire.

The Guesser class generates a random number that the players have to guess. The Player class allows the players to enter their guesses. The Umpire class decides the winner and displays the result on the console.

To play the game, the user needs to execute the Guesser_game.java file in a Java development environment or using the command line.
